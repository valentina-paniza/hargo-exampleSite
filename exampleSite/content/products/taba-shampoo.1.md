Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. To assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample, pathologists typically focus on the regions which contain the IDC. As a result, one of the common pre-processing steps for automatic aggressiveness grading is to delineate the exact regions of IDC inside of a whole mount slide.

The image dataset consists of 400 H&E stain images (2048 × 1536 pixels). All the images are digitized with the same acquisition conditions, with a magnification of 200 × and pixel size of 0.42 µm × 0.42 µm. Each image is labeled with one of the four balanced classes: normal, benign, in situ, and invasive, where class is defined as a predominant cancer type in the image. The image-wise annotation was performed by two medical experts. The goal of the challenge is to provide an automatic classification of each input image.
